0," is a masterpiece, a work of art that you will love for its ingenious story pop-culture, references to logical puzzles and co-op multiplayer. Definitely a candidate for game of the year. [Issue#204]",Portal 2
1,"Skyrim is definitely one of the best games of 2011, but if the DLC holds out, it might just be one of the best games of 2012 as well.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
2,"Beautiful graphics, that wonderful soundtrack, the enthralling story and that damn annoying fairy, the 3DS version has it all and is easily the best port to ever be made of the legend.",The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D
3," is one of those games that rightly garnered much attention with the end of 2011 Game of the Year lists. Maybe it didn't get as much attention from PC gamers, but it should. If you want to have the definitive Arkham City experience, I'd say PC is the way to go.",Batman: Arkham City
4,"There's no question – if you own a 3DS, this is the best game on the platform, and instantly worthy of a purchase. It's one of the best portable platformers I've ever played (and I've had my fair share), and an almost shockingly good Mario title on any platform.",Super Mario 3D Land
5,There are only a few games this year we suggest to 16-yrs old gamers and their fathers together. Human Revolution for sure is a Game of the Year nominee.[Oct 2011],Deus Ex: Human Revolution
6,Pullblox is one of the finest titles currently available for the 3DS and even in a world where iPhone games can cost under a pound there's no questioning the value for money that Pullblox provides; it's really is a massive game with near-endless customisability.,Pushmo
7,It's the ideal example of evolution trumping revolution in creating great video games.,Total War: Shogun 2
8,"Finally the PC version of FIFA 12 features the same quality of its console counterpart, both in terms of graphics and gameplay. So you got some new, cool features: from Tactical Defending to Impact Engine, from a brand new career mode to Online Seasons. Maybe FIFA 12 is not the perfect soccer game, but it's damn close.",FIFA Soccer 12
9,As a complete package  absolutely delivers and if you don't have some angry agenda against Origin it's a must-play. The PC version in particular ushers in a new era of graphical magnificence and the disparity between the consoles begs Sony and Microsoft to up the ante. Shooters don't come much better than this and it's a great way to kick off this year's holiday game rush.,Battlefield 3
10, is a wonderfully dark experience with its only real flaw being its stunted length.,LIMBO
11,"As good as open world action gets. [May 2011, p.58]",Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood
12, is one of the finest examples of how great an RPG can be.,The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings
13,"Many horror games are able to deliver shocks during play, but none does it as well as . Isaac's inner struggle in the tense setting of ""Sprawl"" provides an unforgettable atomsphere, making  one of the most terrifying and unmissable horror games this generation and the benchmark for others to follow.",Dead Space 2
14," is one of the most original titles I've played in quite some time. From the charming graphics to the smooth vibes of the narrator perfectly blended with a magical soundtrack, and the 10-12 hours of action-packed exploration and combat,  is like kicking back with your favorite interactive storybook.",Bastion
15, meets and exceeds all my expectations as a sequel and a next-gen shooter.,Crysis 2
16,A fantastic achievement for Codemasters that will do fans proud.,DiRT 3

18,"This is a full-featured port on a new platform, and it is without question the best portable fighting game ever released.",Super Street Fighter IV: 3D Edition
19,"I'm hardly a hardcore strategy nerd, so maybe it's the accessibility and surface-level depth I can get down with. I can't wait to dig deeper to see what else I'll enjoy about this topnotch turn-based masterpiece.",Frozen Synapse
20,"With almost ten years of thrilling races behind them, even the most fine-tuned racing fireballs can show signs of fatigue. But rather than risking a break-down, Nintendo was smart enough to dismantle its Mario Kart core formula in order to correctly refreshen each and every one of its clogs before putting them back together. As an added bonus, the mechanic repainted it nicely and added some of the latest technologies. The end result roars at soon as the engine starts, and promises to run nicely for quite some time thanks to solid online features.",Mario Kart 7
21,"They have succeeded far beyond my admittedly high expectations. As a KOTOR fan, I finally have my long-awaited sequel(s). As an MMO fan, I am hooked. As a Star Wars fan, I am enthralled.",Star Wars: The Old Republic
22,"Saints Row The Third surprised the heck out of me. The GTA comparisons are inevitable, but they are vastly different games. While both hold a mirror up to reality, the reflections are vastly different. As absurd as GTA gets, it still keeps one foot firmly planted in reality. Saints Row has taken a flying leap off the roof of reality, howling the F-bomb while chugging a licensed energy drink all the way down… and I wouldn't have it any other way.",Saints Row: The Third
23,"Due to its extreme complexity,  will never be a title for everyone. Too deep and articulate for casual players, it will be appreciated only by those who are willing to engage themselves with the deep game mechanics Nevertheless Spece chem is no doubt one of the most brilliant puzzle game in the history of videogames.",SpaceChem
24,"The perfect entry point into the series for PC gamers. Time to clear some desk space. [Sept 2011, p.82]",Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition
25,"More complete, more polished and more addictive than any previous edition, FM 2012 is coming to claim all of your free time.",Football Manager 2012

27,The Binding Of Isaac is pitch-black and hard as hell.,The Binding of Isaac
28,"Alone or with friends,  is simply one of the best PC games you can play this year. You can check out the demo on Steam if you need further convincing because words and screenshots simply don't do this game justice. Just make sure you experience the magical of . It is an unforgettable adventure that will keep you glued to your PC for days and weeks to come.",Trine 2

31,ANNO 2070 is the perfect game for everyone who loves to tweak an economy and build large scale cities. Especially the endgame is really complex with many things to do. A must have for every ANNO-Player.,Anno 2070
32,"An incredibly robust and enjoyable take on the tower defense genre. Tight controls, a plethora of options, and a general fun factor that keeps you coming back again, and again, and again. It is hard not to love this game.",Orcs Must Die!
33,"Still,  is a great adventure, one of the best sandbox games around, and an absolute steal for ten bucks on Steam. It's well worth checking out for anyone, regardless of how they feel about Minecraft. Despite having one fewer dimension,  hides greater depth than its 3D cousin.",Terraria
34,"The wannabe detective's definitive version to plump for. [Feb 2012, p.101]",L.A. Noire: The Complete Edition
35,"The game's design is immaculate, playing a bit like a cross between Metroid and Super Meat Boy. It works hard to be as non-linear as possible, and it never relies on the same ideas for too long, which keeps the excitement coming at a steady pace.",VVVVVV
36,"Next evolution in F1 simulators is accessible to a mass audience and offers cutting-edge technologies and a stunning atmosphere along with ""sweat and blood"". [Oct 2011]",F1 2011

38,"Speaking for myself, I'd rather play through Cave Story again five times than have a second run through the tedious and dated Ocarina of Time, and discovering this game's unique world in a new 3D format has been surprisingly rewarding. It may very well be the 3DS' best game to date.",Cave Story 3D
39," is equal parts tense, thoughtful, and surprising; it's the single best, most compelling adventure game I've played in years.",Gemini Rue
40,"If you were like me and worried about , you can relax. It's not quite the same game, but where it's different it is better.",Dragon Age II
41,"You can't knock the quality of the game, as Vicarious Visions not only made an awesome 3D platformer, they made a great 3DS-exclusive title.",Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure
42,"Brilliant design; a reward-happy, lighthearted multiplayer fray. One of the finest $15 shooters ever made.",Monday Night Combat
43,"An incredibly welcome breath of fresh air. Never underestimate the simple need to let loose and cause some mayhem, and the skill shot system is exceptionally done.",Bulletstorm
44,"You will love it though if you chose the Weird Wasteland perk, loved the Vault filled with Garys in 3, or just don't mind playing through an extremely funny and well-written DLC pack that throws interesting surprises at you all the time, rewards exploration greatly, and packs more imagination and play-time in it than nearly every other full-priced game out there.",Fallout: New Vegas - Old World Blues
45,"To The Moon is one of those games you instantly fall in love with.
With it's simple, but elegant design, incredible writing, and
thrilling, heartfelt tale, To The Moon is more story than game, but
what a story it is.",To the Moon
46,"There's some serious challenge to the game if you take the time to find it, and that holds true with the 3DS version as well. Also, the game is well suited to portable play, as each mission only takes about 5 to 10 minutes to complete.",Star Fox 64 3D
47,"If you enjoyed the puzzle nature of Portal and the action of Shadow Complex, there is no reason why you shouldn't play . Even if you didn't particularly like those games, I feel that you should give it a shot. Not only is  fun to play, it is incredibly well built and glistens with polish.",Rochard
48,It just does its style of controlled chaos really well.,Jamestown: Legend of the Lost Colony
49,"This is the most complete, large, fun and ambitious Trackmania game ever made. It improves upon the formula that has make the game succeed, and again challenges us to beat our best times and also our rivals'. And at a very attractive price.",TrackMania 2 Canyon
50," has a vibrant, cartoony look and feel while providing an addictive and solid tower defense gaming experience. Reinventing tower defense is a tough chore but  manages to pull it off.",Dungeon Defenders
51,"There's not much to say in summary other than ""It's a bargain!""",Anomaly: Warzone Earth
52," is maybe rough around the edges, has things that could have been better and has some strange solutions to gaming mechanics, but really, who cares? The main thing, close combat with zombies on an open environment, is both exceptionally well done and most importantly, great fun. Even alone. In the land of blindingly pretty, but simplified tubeshooters the ugly zombie game is the king. [Sept 2011]",Dead Island
53,"Revelations closes the Assassin's Creed journey with a familiar looking videogame, but a new iteration so epic and amazing as you might expect. It's a worthy end for the first volume of the series.",Assassin's Creed: Revelations
54,"Unique and confident in its place in the free-to-play world, this team-based MMO is a surefire winner, balancing fun with depth and detail with action.",World of Tanks
55,"It's nothing revolutionary as far as Dawn of War II goes, but six excellent campaigns and great gameplay make this a must for both Warhammer 40K and RTS fans.","Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Retribution"
56," has brought back a flood of wonderful memories for me and while I fully realize that I'm a certified Panzer General fan boy and that could possibly cloud my judgment of the merits of , all I know is that my campaign ended in a German defeat.",Panzer Corps
57,"A true salvation for a nearly-dead franchise. [October 2011, p.68]",Driver: San Francisco
58,"Capsized recalls memories of Turrican, Commander Keen, and Cybernator, but this is not a nostalgic retro-rehash. You won't find chunky pixels, chiptune soundtracks, or tongue-in-cheek nods to the past. Capsized is a modern original; a nearly pitch-perfect blend of combat and exploration that manages to be as beautiful as it is exhilarating.",CAPSIZED
59,"Having played both Super Street Fighter IV and Dead or Alive Dimensions, DOAD is far superior is our books and is easily one of the best fighters available on any portable console. The gameplay is flawlessly fun and even though we have seen it all before, this may be the fact on home consoles but not in the portable world of gaming. The developers have included enough fan service to make any Dead or Alive fanboy or girl glee from joy but best of all, it's got the gameplay and the graphics.",Dead or Alive: Dimensions
60,Help Brian and Gina to solve their last adventure - It's definitely worth the while.,Runaway: A Twist of Fate
61,"Instantly accessible, free for the base game, an active community that's happy to accommodate new players and a combat system that's got plenty of room to grow, Funcom have whacked this one out of the park.",Bloodline Champions
62,"There is a truly massive amount of game here for the $5 asking price, and Gaslamp Games has clearly set Dredmor apart from the crowd. If you've ever felt the need to crawl a dungeon, this one is most definitely for you, as it serves as both an excellent ""my first roguelike"" and a challenging quest for the experienced spelunker.",Dungeons of Dredmor
63,"In terms of RAGEs story, there is a lot of wasted potential in this otherwise brilliant shooter. The same could be said for the technical side of things, as RAGE undoubtedly looks good, but far from brilliant, ""thanks"" to its multiplatform-roots. Nevertheless: id's newest IP offers great atmosphere, spot-on gunplay, cool weapons, funny vehicle-combat and solid graphics; that leaves us hoping for Carmack's promised texture-patch.",Rage
64,The best add-on for The Sims 3 so far. Pets bring a lot of extra playability. Pet lovers hardly find anything better to play. Unicorn included! [Dec 2011],The Sims 3: Pets
65,"It's short but sweet, which I personally prefer over games that overstay their welcome. It's also a pleasure to play, with a satisfying mix of action/platformer pizzazz and puzzle elements with a steady, addictive progression from those simple first stages to the devious concoctions of the late game.",Mighty Switch Force!
66,"A worthwhile add-on to its predecessor. Most weaknesses like clunky animations and a troublesome interface have been eliminated, and you'll play about 14 hours - so much more than these very popular mini-DLCs nowadays.",Two Worlds II: Pirates of the Flying Fortress
67,"Modern Warfare 3 is pure perfection in gameplay and graphics, and it's only going to get better as more DLC arrives and the game is refined and balanced as the designers analyze real-time data from all the matches being played. There is no fan base more loyal than Call of Duty, and this game is guaranteed to delight all who play now and in the years to come.",Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3
68,"Somehow, despite the complexity, Devil Survivor Overclocked manages to remain accessible throughout.",Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked
69,"Overall though,  was a delightful experience. It made some incredibly useful changes and additions to gameplay while maintaining the heart of the Tropico series. And the annoyances were few and far between enough that this title is worth turning on again and again. Viva la Tropico!",Tropico 4
70,"Overall, the general feel of Shadow Wars is a solid turn-based strategy game -- even if its story backdrop, limited multiplayer, and character archetypes are short on originality.",Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars
71,"It feels refreshing to be able to say that Sonic is good again. His upward trajectory over the last year continues and he's only gaining momentum.  is largely a game for the most hardcore of Sonic fans, but for the millions who have fond memories of narrowly dodging spikes, grinding on rails, or even that time he was a pinball,  is a game made for you.",Sonic Generations
72,"Vivid and tactically demanding, Assault Squad is a brilliant multiplayer game that's even better with friends. [June 2011, p.78]",Men of War: Assault Squad
73,"For those who haven't had chance to play it, there is no better recommendation in 3D line Classics.",3D Classics: Kirby's Adventure
74,"Overall, Prejudice is a vast improvement over the original with new modes to experience, polished controls and an even deeper customization system. If you're looking for a fun time alone or to share with some friends, for $15 you really can't go wrong here.",Section 8: Prejudice
75,"Might & Magic Heroes VI is a solid installment of the popular turn-based strategy series, probably one of the best.",Might & Magic: Heroes VI
76,"Konami has improved the AI a lot and everything just feels smoother and more direct. It's not a revolution, but a more polished and improved version of the game.",Pro Evolution Soccer 2012
77,"Taking everything into consideration, it's safe to say that  is a must play for any fan of turn based strategy games, as it is one that I'll be playing for some time to come.",Xenonauts
78,"Overall, Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 is a relatively by-the-numbers enhancement of the previous game. Normally these sorts of increments would be frustrating, but considering the tremendous value the game presents to causal Magic fans it's easy to overlook another purchase when compared to the alternative. For the cost of a few booster packs, Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 provides a balanced, enjoyable experience that Magic fans of all levels can enjoy – at least until next year.",Magic: The Gathering - Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012
79,"It's accessible, it's decent fun, and there's a metric ton of content.",The Sims Medieval
80,"This great adventure is entertaining for adults and children alike. [Sept 2011, p.73]",Hamilton's Great Adventure
81,"An unusual yet beautiful game bound to remind you of nature's power. [Oct 2011, p.50]",From Dust
82,The co-op is a nice topping on a delicious slice of retro action – but you might still feel hungry afterwards.,Renegade Ops
83,"Overall, I really enjoyed . Even if you're not a huge fan of the LEGO titles, it's hard to deny that Traveler's Tales has managed to refine the formula of what makes these games work. Toss in the standard co-op mode, which is always a lot of fun, and you've got a great time-waster on your hands here.",LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars
84,"The basic fact is that Red Orchestra 2 spoils you. Playing any other shooter, especially one that claims to be realistic, after going through a few rounds in RO2 is bound to be a disappointment.",Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad
85,"Pretty much what you'd expect if PopCap made a shooter.  is a quirky, amusing, and hugely replayable shmup at a wonderfully low asking price.",Who's That Flying?!
86,"One of the best ways to spend 20 bucks. Incredibly strong and fascinating online action. [December 2011, p.83]",Payday: The Heist
87,"If you are looking for a really good role playing game, that keeps up with a straight but good story, you will find it in . Your character can live through a lot of customization and the world is rich of 70 hours of action-role playing with more than 300 quests.",Two Worlds II
88,"What I do know is this: despite the million dollar game budgets that have taken us to this age of gaming, we are still in a place where a studio like Spiderweb Software exists to give us . This game reminded me of some of the best games I've ever played. Perhaps most importantly, it made me want more. Despite the fact that it probably won't be for everybody, and despite the fact that the mainstream may have moved away from this type of game forever, I'm still giving it an Editor's Choice award.",Avadon: The Black Fortress
89,Black Mirror 3 is the third instalment in the horror-thriller point'n click adventure series and definitely the best one yet. It's a little better than its predecessors in every aspect: the story has more intensity and puzzles are a little bit more polished. BM 3 offers a decent ending to the sinister saga of the Gordons. On the minus side the inventory is cumbersome and the grande finale loses some of the game's otherwise compelling atmosphere. Still it's worth the while. [Aug 2011],Black Mirror III: Final Fear
90,"Honestly if not for some minor complaints Red Faction Armageddon would be a damn near perfect game. As it is, this is a strong contender for best game of the year for its fantastic mix of intense action, fun character customization that changes how you play the game, great graphics and all around fantastic gameplay experience. Even the minor flaws are easily ignored and most will likely not even notice them, as wrapped up in the game as they will be.",Red Faction: Armageddon
91,"Bit.Trip SAGA stands alone as a visually enhanced, portable repackaging of some of the best games of this generation of consoles. Just like Paris, Bit.Trip SAGA is for lovers.",Bit.Trip Saga
92,It wraps up all the plotlines and does a fantastic job of it.,Back to the Future: The Game - Episode V: OUTATIME
93,"The short, breakneck campaigns create a compelling game you'll likely revisit time and time again. It's the perfect blend of planning and reflexes, requiring you to thoroughly plan every move but remain highly reactive and adaptable.",Atom Zombie Smasher
94,"The suffering world of Albion has arrived on the PC, and it is up to you to choose a side. Especially for casual action-rpg fans an easy-going and satisfying concept.",Fable III
95,"I have to hand it to Namco-Bandai: With the exception of omitting online multiplayer, it really put together a solid entry in the series for the 3DS launch, one that's easily high on the list of best titles available for the new system.",Ridge Racer 3D
96,"So if you love a fun and challenging shooter with a clever mix of styles and a killer assortment of boss battles then  is definitely worth checking out. While 32 levels might sound like a lot, they are surprisingly short and fast, and competent gamers can blast their way through the Story Mode in 3-4 hours, but with the endless appeal of Arcade and Boss Rush modes there is enough addictive old-school arcade goodness to keep coming back for more microscopic carnage time and time again.",Nano Assault
97," reminds me a lot of classic N64 platformers like Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie in the best of ways. By mixing a dark reimagining of a literary classic with stylish combat and rock-solid platforming, EA and Spicy Horse have created a gaming experience quite unlike any other. At any rate, its miles better than the lacklustre Tim Burton movie released last year. This is one rabbit hole worth tumbling down.",Alice: Madness Returns
98,"Hector Badge of Carnage: We Negotiate With Terrorists is a great little adventure that's often shocking, frequently offensive and always hilarious. Despite (or perhaps because of) its gross out moments and unabashedly low-brow humor, it's one of the most entertaining, unique adventure games most of us have seen in longer than we'd like to remember.",Hector: Badge of Carnage - Episode 1: We Negotiate With Terrorists
99," is a prime example of what a graphic adventure should be. It's got it all: an entertaining story, great writing, creative but logical puzzles, good voice acting and music, beautiful artwork and a killer sense of humor.",The Next Big Thing
100,"If you played the first episode, you'll definitely like this one. I can't recommend this episode, as well as the full package, enough.",Back to the Future: The Game - Episode II: Get Tannen!
101,"In it's PC porting, EDGE retains most of its good qualities as a funny action/platformer.",Edge (2011)
102,"Tetris: Axis is one of the sweetest 3DS games you'll find. It lacks the fun Nintendo themed stages that made Tetris DS unforgettable, but there's so much content, we doubt players will mind; and seriously, you should already own a copy of Tetris DS anyway.",Tetris Axis
103,But suffice to say  isn't just a grand open-world space action RPG in the tradition of Star Control. It's also a rare expression of zombies that belongs alongside Dead Rising and Atom Zombie Smasher.,Space Pirates and Zombies
104,"The rich, luscious colors somehow make the world a lot more believable than games like Crysis 2 could ever be.",Magicka
105,"If you're a fan of the Warhammer 40k machine or just looking for some good old fashioned action then look no further than Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine for PC.","Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine"
106,"In the end,  is a great game.",F.E.A.R. 3
107," has faults - it's samey and repetitive in long-play sessions, for example, and if the trailers don't tickle you then there's little chance the full game will impress. However, considering the low price and artistic spark that lies at the heart of the game,  becomes a difficult game to turn down, even if the mechanical side of the experience doesn't quite rival the creative side, and there are occasional glitches with the physics of enemy AI.",Rock of Ages
108,"Both a throwback and an innovation. It takes a formula pioneered decades ago, puts a fantasy story and theme over it, and perfects the concept with clever and challenging level design.",Fortix 2
109,"The Missing Link is one of the best DLC releases ever. Even though it's a bit pricey, it's very much worth the price. There's a lot of stuff to do, interesting combat and best of all, the new in-house made boss fight is infinitely more fun than the useless bosses at the original Human Revolution. [Nov 2011]",Deus Ex: Human Revolution - The Missing Link
110,"Hector: Badge of Carnage is without question, one of the best new adventures-in fact, one of the best game properties-to come out in recent memory. With its likeably slobbish anti-hero and the possibility for endless story setups, we adventure fans would do well to cross our fingers that the collaboration between Telltale and Straandlooper continues well beyond the current trilogy.",Hector: Badge of Carnage - Episode 2: Senseless Acts of Justice
111,"Overall, Lego: Pirates was a game experience I'd be willing to play over and over again in order to complete all of the side objectives in the game. Initially getting through the puzzles is engaging and being able to go back later and unlock all the things I couldn't access before is made less tedious by just how nice the game looks to play and the de-emphasis on the combat. And the fact that I'm playing with pirates, which as we all know are far more awesome than ninjas.",LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game
112,"It's seriously one of the best adventure games I've played in years that has words in it (I'm looking at you, Machinarium). It doesn't just tell a good story, it's tightly plotted too.",The Blackwell Deception
113,"A challenging, rewarding and sublime homage to the early days of the first-person shooter - with a few modern twists. [Dec 2011, p.58]",Hard Reset

115,"7 quid is a good price for a universe. [Sept 2011, p.89]",Solar 2
116,"When all is said and done, Serious Sam 3 is just plain refreshing. It's nice to have a game that relies so much on flat-out enemy decimation, and which does it so well, so beautifully, and while providing at least the opportunity to share the experience with friends online.",Serious Sam 3: BFE
117,"I had a ball playing it, and seven hours passed without me noticing. I recommend  to fans of blocks, and just about anyone who loves indie games.",Blocks That Matter
118,"This isn't the sort of MMO that asks you to park for hours on end several nights in a row. It's more of a co-operative or competitive multiplayer action game, perfect for short intense visits. And because your character doesn't sport rows of tiny icons for a thousand different skills, DC Universe is also perfect for less frequent visits.",DC Universe Online
119,"Misdirection, manipulation, and an inventory filled with objects are the tools of the stage magician, but they're also the basics of the adventure-game genre. Why it's taken so long for the two to be combined is anyone's guess, but in , the fit is so natural that it seems like it's the way adventure games always should have been.",Gray Matter
120,"If you can stomach the controls, you'll find a well-polished action RPG beneath that surface.",Dungeon Siege III
121,"Atari's latest open-world racer serves up hotter cars, warmer climates and more torrid racing action than its predecessor. [April 2011, p.70]",Test Drive Unlimited 2
122,Quotation forthcoming.,FIFA Manager 12
123,"As impressive as some of Nintendogs + Cats is on a technological level, I failed miserably to really get anything out of it. However, I'm not the target market in this case and my daughter had no problem awarding the game a very good score.",Nintendogs + Cats: French Bulldog & New Friends
124,"An awesome piece of very approachable (if not plain too easy) fan service and, in this case, pleasing fans ain't bad at all.",Back to the Future: The Game - Episode III: Citizen Brown

128,"If you're already played it in the Wii version, exploring it on 3DS is both familiar and different. [Jan 2012, p.91]",LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7
129,A surprisingly deep and well-designed FPS/RTS hybrid. A Team Fortress 2 alternative that needs a community to thrive.,Nuclear Dawn
130,"In all fairness though  is one of the best aerial combat games that I've ever played and the folks over at Namco Bandai delivered another fantastic addition to their critically acclaimed franchise. It has the right amount of action, easy to use and fluid controls and great visuals for a 3DS title.  is totally worth the price of admission and a must have if you own a Nintendo 3DS.",Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy
131,Black Mirror 2 is a great adventure with a creepy atmosphere and great gameplay! Recommendable for fans of the genre and everybody else!,Black Mirror II: Reigning Evil
132,"A challenging game that is a little rough around the edges in some ways and the audio is a big overall step down from past games. However, the overall experience is a must for anyone who enjoyed prior games in the series, or even the Wii Sports Resort flight mini-games.",Pilotwings Resort

The heavy reuse of assets makes it a chore to get through levels after you've done a couple of them, and the gameplay boils down to little more than using jump as often as possible and shooting your assault rifle, regardless of what you're facing or where you are.

276,"It's one of the best platformers I've ever laid hands on, and it's a shame that I waited this long to play it. How this game didn't top more lists than it did as possible GOTY material in 2011 is beyond me, because it certainly deserves all the accolades it's received thus far (and more!). I don't toss out the A+ often (in fact, this is a first), but Origins totally fits the bill of what an A+ experience is all about.",Rayman Origins
277,"Simply put,  is a phenomenal game. It's incredibly polished, and everything just feels like it's in the right place when you're playing. It's tons of fun to play and never takes itself too seriously, and there are some great pop culture references sprinkled throughout. It's a great pickup for both action RPG fans and newcomers alike, at $20 it's the best bargain that there is in gaming, and something I would recommend to anyone without hesitation.",Torchlight II

279,"Games this thoughtfully crafted don't happen very often, and the care that Blizzard has taken with Diablo 3 shows in every facet of its design and execution. It might not be perfect, but after 45 hours, I'm not sure where it missteps, and after 45 hours, I feel like I've only scratched the surface of what it has to offer. Diablo 3 is almost evil in how high a bar it's set for every PC action RPG to follow, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that bar remain for a very long time.",Diablo III

He's such a great character and is very funny throughout the game, especially in the way he deals with some of the side-quests that characters give him.

But the true strong point of the game is in its addictive gameplay, the possibility to shift between 2D and 3D serves both the game and the story by providing us with a peep of the real world, seen through a game of shadows.

It has its moments of frustration with the difficulty, but the weapons and score-based mechanics really make it shine over other titles in the genre.

Like Sorcery, it never really transcends the cheesy sword-and-board adventure-fantasy of the original adventure gamebook it sources from, but that’s not really the point is it? Hell, the archetypal characters and straightforward questing are part of the charm.

While some of the original game’s problems are still present, improvements made to the fluidity of battles and player freedom more than make up for it.

Plus, even if you’ve seen some of these cars and tracks before they’ve never looked or felt this good. Racing is exciting in Forza 7 and accessible at any skill level. If you were to strip away the visuals and leave behind the core mechanics of racing hundreds of cars across numerous tracks, Forza 7 is still one of the most well rounded and solid racers ever created.",Forza Motorsport 7

I can’t even tell who gets the better deal here between fans of the original or newcomers like me.

Wryn is still the same cool chick she always was, ready to kick some you-know-what as before, except this time for less selfish reasons. The action anti-heroine has become a real heroine, and the bosses have got more creative and include more variety.

I enjoyed the game more after playing it on a larger television screen because the game’s beauty and detail are done justice on a 55” screen as opposed to the smaller OLED on the Vita.

The characters are full of life and have personality, which is surprising, considering they exist in a puzzle game. They have a range of facial expressions that make me laugh every time I play.

The sole focus on Kazuma as the protagonist makes for a more focused adventure than Yakuza 4 and 5, and it’s nice to see how Kazuma builds his reputation as the Dragon of Dojima with this game.

I still feel like it was perfectly built to be played on a handheld, the tilting just fits it more naturally, but since the Vita is all but dead, the PS4 is the only option we have, and that’s fine by me. Another PSP cult classic, Patapon, looks to be the next PSP remaster to come to the PS4 and based on the sales of these I’m hopeful Sony invests in more PSP titles that haven’t seen the light of day since the handheld died.

Arena modes are the purest form of the idea that combat is the pinnacle of fun in games, so Taro made an arena mode that undermines that very foundation. The best part, though, is what comes after you’ve finished all three colosseums (and no, I’m not talking about the well-publicised CEO boss fight). The arenas represent maybe three quarters of the DLC, and thought-provoking as they are, they’re not a patch on the final chapter. I’ll leave it at that, because it’s best discovered with as little prior knowledge as possible, but suffice to say that 3C3C1D119440927 is a lot, lot more than just an arena mode with some costumes attached.

It has everything a good point-and-click should have from meaningful world engagement and enjoyable dialogue to good, old-fashioned, item-heavy puzzle solving. That said, it’s clearly a journey that Studio Fizbin isn’t out to bar anyone from for the sake of nostalgic difficulty. Their adaption of point-and-click mechanics to modern times with things like the hint system ensures that the only thing keeping a player from moving forward at any point is their own stubborn resolve. It could have better character animations at times to go with all of the solid and wonderful things built visually, aurally, and mechanically around these characters.

I think it builds upon the first game in a really solid fashion, and does so while still feeling fresh and enjoyable to play. The A.I. can be really spotty, but overall that’s a fairly minor complaint for a game that honestly doesn’t have many issues to speak of.

Only after emerging victorious against fake international flying disc enthusiasts and human players did I get why the game received the attention it did. For something made over twenty years ago, it still has legs and the entertainment value to stay in the consciousness of new gamers and those that still play cash games of Warlords to this day.

Story-wise, it’s a lot of little bits of storytelling to push you further on into the destabilisation of Santa Blanca, offering just enough to tide you over.

Not shy to difficulty, the mechanics take a great deal of reflexive skill and hand-eye co-ordination to master, but they never feel impossible to grasp. The split mechanic requires the use of both analogue sticks, often in synchronicity, and is only enhanced by level design that encourages skilled play while also not keeping anyone struggling to adapt to the control scheme out.

I don’t know if it will catch on, or how widely it will spread, but it establishes everything that it needs to.

3052,"Culdcept Saga is, with or without dice, absolutely brilliant, and the kind of game I can see myself playing for a very long time into the future.

3053," is a fantastic option for seasoned RTS fans that are looking for something new and a little different.

3054,"Episode 2 proved excellent all the way around. I really appreciated the points they chose to hit, the themes of friendship and change, as well as the fantastic trip the Admin takes the group on.

Though its opening hours retrace the first Yo-Kai Watch a bit too faithfully, the rest of the experience is absolutely worth it; this is an endlessly charming RPG that captures the fun and wonder of childhood adventure, with the added excitement of a few hundred paranormal pals. This Psychic Specters edition perfects the formula, and if you’ve never played any version of Yo-Kai Watch 2, this is the one to get — though even if you’ve already pledged allegiance to the Bony Spirits or Fleshy Souls, there’s plenty here to draw you back in, and a save-import function means you won’t have to start from scratch.

If you’re willing to give up mods, multiplayer and DLC in exchange for portability, then I’d say the Switch Edition does deserve a look.

The blue and gold jellyfish are controlled using both halves of the Switch’s Joycons, making it extraordinarily easy for two people to work together--a noticeable difference, I assume, from the PC and PlayStation versions of the game.

This is a beautifully written, immersive psychological thriller which tells a compelling, tragic story, demands observation, planning and problem solving, and yes, also throws a few shriek-worthy jump-scares into the mix. It leaves you questioning reality and explores just what a person and the human mind can handle when pushed to the limit. Solid voice acting and narration makes this an incredibly personal story, and while it’s not entirely free of motion sickness, being aware of where your head and body are can help you avoid the worst of it. Odds are, you’ll be so full of adrenaline that you probably won’t fully register the motion sickness until you take off the headgear.  is a shining example of a virtual reality psychological thriller done right, and a is must play for any horror junkie.",Narcosis

One where I'll be sitting there and go, ""Jeeze, I think it's about time to play it again."" I'm halfway tempted to go back and check out the older games, but 's campaign is just something sublime that I'm going to be revisiting frequently when I get the RTS itch. The shame is that I didn't enjoy the multiplayer as much as the single-player, as while the gameplay mechanics stay intact it loses a lot of that luster. A final note: the campaign, being only 21 missions along with the less enjoyable multiplayer, may not be enough for many people to pay out the $49.99 price tag. It's a bit steep, but I still say it's a must play for any RTS fan.",Sudden Strike 4

The PlayLink concept, which allows you to play each with a smartphone or a tablet, is really cool and well designed : you all go very quickly and easily into the game... even if the final drawing test (co-operative drawings) slows down things a little. The pace of each game is also a bit repetitive if you chain too much, a little more variety in the types of events would have been welcome... but it remains that the experience is still very fun, if your friend are, obviously, if you all know each other very well, and if you are at least 3 or 4 players around the PS4.",That's You!

It is, however, a short experience, but there are enough challenges, variety and enjoyment to be had.

The action goes at an almost non-stop clip, and there's rarely any time to breathe before you have to unleash triple-number combos again and again. There's a ton of content to go over, and while the story can be nonsensical at times, it remains entertaining for those who aren't averse to anime or a visual novel style of game.

That generic androgynous robot (Salli, for the record) turns out to be funny, and is constantly trash-talking and praising players by name. This extends to the app/controller as well, with tailored messages flashing on each player’s screen at the end of every round, giving them text they can share via social media that say how well they did in a particular round (note: I did not do this).

This change allows the tactical side of combat to flourish in a new way and one anyone who enjoys the Wars games will find it fun. It controls easily with a base controller, and while PC users can get a bit of an edge using a mouse to traverse maps, it isn’t a game-breaking issue for those prefer a pad. It’s a gorgeous-looking game with a cartoony art style that adds a touch of slapstick to battles, which remain funny thanks to voice clips that entertain until they get a bit too long in the tooth due to repetition. Minor quibbles aside, though,  is an excellent tactical RPG at the end of the day and one that longtime fans of the genre should check out.",Tiny Metal

It offers an original story from the creator of the One Piece universe, and it features smooth combat, a gorgeous world that has clearly received a lot of development attention, a ton of DLC, and it's wallet-friendly to boot. My only nitpicks have to do with the camera being too close to the character, which interrupted the fluidity of traversing the world, and there were a few slow points in the story due to a lack of clarity in missions.

Rooted in various theatrical styles that give it an aesthetic and tone that I find so appealing, it’s not the kind of game that could ever hope to find mainstream acceptance, but that’s not unusual for Gust JRPGs.

It’s hard not to search a crime scene for clues with your unresponsive PlayLink app and come away wishing that you were just using a plain controller.

3209," delivers a lot of fun, even if the overall package could stand to have some room for improvement. The Way of the Hado mode is mere filler, but the core game is an absolute blast. Using either the original or revamped art works well, and you can alternate between each style along with changing the music from the original to remixes before a full gameplay session.

That being said, it's gameplay, although standard, doesn't bring anything distinctly unique to the table and often the puzzles are just too simple. It's also unfortunate that the game is fairly short and doesn’t offer any replay value at all to allow you to squeeze a few more hours out of it.",Toby: The Secret Mine

However, the draw distances are terrible, multiplayer isn’t available at the beginning, and it won’t stack up to the console versions.

3268,"Ultimately, the small amount of content at launch is ’s greatest weakness. With no story whatsoever, only four characters, and four levels, it feels more like an early access game than a full release, although its low price point does somewhat reflect this. The core mechanics are solid the characters all feature distinct combat styles, so it does offer an engaging, immersive tower defense experience, especially on higher difficulties and with more players added.

There is an untapped market in games like this, one that Tartarus may have very well spearheaded here in 2017.

3277,"School Girl/Zombie Hunter does almost everything right. I could pretend to be annoyed that the story never gets around to explaining who the villain was or what he was doing, but the writing does such a good job of making the heroines’ emotional journeys resonate that the fact that their story doesn’t make sense is a minor quibble at best. It’s a game about teenagers with assault rifles shooting technicolor zombies – how much sense does it need to make? The missions are well designed, the dialogue is witty, and the combat mechanics are solid. The low-budget look and grindhouse premise make me feel like I should be apologizing for loving this game, but I’m not — this is one of the most delightful things I’ve played all year.",SG/ZH: School Girl Zombie Hunter

The great irony about that is that it’s far more pertinent and relevant, and asks genuine questions, about a topic that is going to be a significant sociological discussion point for generations going forward.",The Caligula Effect

The game is really impressively designed with solid gameplay and lovely aesthetics – in fact, the only fault I can find is that I wish there were more modes to play.

3286,"The combat isn’t stellar, the levels themselves leave a lot to be desired, and the story is honestly forgettable. It’s a shame that what makes the RWBY animated series so great could not be translated into its first proper video game. Still, the campaign offers around 5-6 hours of playtime and it’s a competent, and even at times fun, hack and slash game that I recommend you play with a group of friends.",RWBY: Grimm Eclipse
3287," is a very entertaining and interesting VR game. The use of the third-person perspective in VR elevates the game and creates a fulfilling and unique experience.

The title fuses fighting games with frenetic on-foot action that feels quite unlike anything you'll ever have played before.

Still, if you’ve got five bucks to spend, and you’re looking for something to play on the Switch, it’s not a bad way to go.

If you’re a fan of 3D platformers that are polished to perfection as in the Super Mario series, I don’t think you’ll enjoy this game. It’s got a niche for sure. But it’s a nice-looking game. The music is pretty and the worlds are fun to explore for awhile.

It's not without fault however, with the over-the-top knock-backs from hits being the biggest irritant. There's some replayability in trying to track down all the fuses and then tackle the harder versions of the levels and the co-op play works well.

Still though, I had a blast playing the game and got a very nostalgic feeling while playing . It retails in the US eShop now for $9.99, and I’d say I got more than enough bang for my buck with this title. If you have no appreciation of classic survival-horror, you will hate this game.

3552,"In some ways,  even improves upon its predecessor. It has a much improved camera, more frequent save points, and cutscenes that don’t show their age, all of which count as plusses in my book. Further, it allows a second player to join in the fun, which is a welcome addition for a game like this one. None of these changes represent massive steps forward, to be sure.

3553,"I’d say that this episode is a pretty great start to the finale of the series for Telltale. It’s been a long, and occasionally bumpy road, but this seems to be shaping up extremely well early on. The cliffhanger for this episode has me anxious to see what happens next, and the new cast of characters are more appealing than most of the hardened jerks that populated The New Frontier. It’ll be interesting to see where things go from here, but again, I’m not holding my breath for a happy ending.",The Walking Dead: The Telltale Series - The Final Season Episode 1: Done Running

The game has a good premise and entertaining gameplay, which may leave you not wanting to put it down. The variety of weapons and costumes make things more charming, and kept things fresh. The game should take at least a couple hours to beat as well.",Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle
3556," feels like a fun new take on several more traditional ideas. These concepts combine beautifully, and gameplay is held back only by the limitations of the camera.

Using 10 seconds of light to find a way out is always full of expectation, especially because the producer made the graphics extremely artistic and beautiful, which reminds me some former masterpieces like Journey or Monument Valley.

The product of one man and a small indie team from Denmark, it’s a game that runs remarkably smoothly considering the detail of its environments and the vibrancy of its art style. The platforming won’t blow you away - especially if you’ve become trained in the twitch arts of Hollow Knight and the like - but with some brilliant puzzles, a rewarding balance between endangered stealth and peaceful exploration and some of the most intense set-pieces we’ve ever played on Switch, Freedom Planet has secured a place as one of 2018’s most important indie releases.",Planet Alpha

My first playthrough clocked in at just under four hours and most of the game is mining, going back to town to cash out and upgrade, and repeat.

3578,"A thrilling adventure game that is sure to please,  does almost everything right. There were too many things I liked about the game to mention (graphics and sound are also top notch). This isn’t Rebellion’s first third-person shooter, and the growth of quality has increased with maturity. The Egyptian theme is everywhere, from the menu system to the excellent narration. It’s as if you were playing an action movie, with the brigade seeming to have their own personal agendas that happen to coincide with saving the world. After the credits roll, you’re more than likely going to go back to the menu and continue playing.",Strange Brigade

The strong point of Rogue is the story of Shay Patrick Cormac which is one of the most interesting in the series. In addition, it completes the events of the American trilogy and connects it with what will happen later in Unity. However, it still has the flaws that it already had in its launch in 2014.

This is a game about environmentalism, respect for the ecosystem, and it's a chance to watch the form that evolution takes in a palatable and enjoyable manner. Wada's most famous work, Harvest Moon, did a remarkable job of highlighting the life of a farmer to people who may have never comprehended what a country lifestyle might look like, so too has he made the basic idea of evolution accessible to people of all ages in .

The game plays great, looks just how I wanted it to, and has that style that really gives off the nostalgic feel.

3698," is a polished, tight and smartly designed single-room physics puzzle platformer wrapped around a unique audio/visual retro bubble. We haven’t been so pleasantly surprised with a game of the genre since the initial Wii release of World Of Goo. Despite failing hard to educate anyone on the human nervous system, in either portable mode or sitting in the sofa like the plot’s protagonist playing in on the big screen TV, this game is a surreal trip very much worth embarking.

3765,"Overall, the game is fantastic. It’s fun for solo play and is even better when working in co-op. I’ve poured hours into the game and have still not completed every possible task available. There’s so much replayability and it’ll have you craving for more Yo-kai madness… or maybe a Yo-kai is making you think that. Regardless, the game is definitely fantastic and I’d highly recommend adding it to your 3DS’s library.",Yo-kai Watch Blasters: Red Cat Corps
3766,"Overall,  is Milestone’s finest game to date. It combines a surprisingly high amount of racing types together and does an exceptional job with all of them. The handling is far better than most of their prior work, and the level of on-screen excitement is at its highest point yet as well. There are some rough edges when it comes to the overall presentation, and the FMV-laden story mode of sorts is somewhat of a groaner, but it doesn’t take away from how fun the core racing action is. It uses rumble better than most games on the market today as well – at least for Xbox One controller users, and is a solid pickup for anyone craving some off-road racing.",Gravel
3767," is a game that you should be playing. The well-realized worlds, exceptional aesthetic and compelling exploration mechanics complement each other tremendously well. If you can get past the occasional bout of unnecessary complex exposition, the evolution of each environment tells a compelling enough story to keep you enthralled from start to finish. Drop everything and check out what deserves to be one of the sleeper hits of 2018.",InnerSpace
3768,"Digital Dreams Entertainment plays a dirty game of football with  for the Nintendo Switch; but the use of vulgarities, complete lack of concern for player safety, and hard-hitting defenses make it a blast to play. There is something strangely satisfying about mutilating an opposing QB and then murdering a referee. If Madden is the NFL, then one could say that Mutant Football League is arena football. It’s unconventional but it is entertaining and it’s the best football game for Switch.",Mutant Football League: Dynasty Edition
3769,"Whether interest lies in the survival horror genre or the first-person action adventure, this is a title that delivers an amazing and heart-pounding 25+ hours. It's also noteworthy that a sandbox mode is coming to the game, but as of release it is not an available option. Hopefully, that means a lot of content post release.",We Happy Few

I would have loved to compete with them for high scores in UTP’s impeccably designed courses.

3776,There’s not a lot to it but what there is can be a pleasant distraction from every day life for a while… even if it does simulate a form of every day life for some people. If you like simulation style games you will most likely find enjoyment in this one… if not then this might be worth giving a miss. For me it was another nice easy going title to add to my collection… now if you don’t mind I’m going to switch the radio to easy listening and raise the ramp and head off.,Bus Simulator 18
3777," is a dark ride through a mad, cosmic horror nightmare with a paranormal detective story as your vehicle.

3780,"Overall, this game left me in shambles as I would feel a sense of extreme dread as I made progress throughout each world as I never fully knew what reaction any of my decisions could cause.

3784," is a deep and challenging experience. There’s an undeniable issue with the game’s somewhat overly loose controls, but with that to the side, this is every bit as engaging as V-Rally has always been.

3789," is a hack-n-slash game that captivated a great many players for over a decade. There have been thousands of mods, skill-sets, skins, and even a few full games made in its wake because of how good it was. Now on console, the game lives again. Maybe a bit too close to the flawed original, and maybe not as hack-friendly as the original, but it gives a chance for a new set of players to battle a titan… and that should be good enough for anyone.",Titan Quest

3791,"Yes, MotoGP 2018 is only an update with some editing of its previous edition. But the job is well done on the important points that matters; driving sensations, adjustable realism at all levels, and comprehensive content regarding the real MotoGP and its virtual transposition. This is as much at the level of the circuits as of the machines and the pilots. We regret the lack of competition that has probably contributed a bit to Milestone laziness. There is still a lot of room for improvements. But if you like the MotoGP, you will not be disappointed by this game that does the job correctly.",MotoGP 18

Its thorough character customization allows you to create your ideal ninja, both in looks and fighting style, and its competent multiplayer action lets you unleash your powers in flashy elegance.

Just because you don’t understand everything right out of the gate doesn’t mean that deep and thoughtful design isn’t present. There is real depth of strategy here, and the fun visuals are just the icing on the cake. I’m hoping that the audience that has currently found  sticks with it (and continues to grow), because this is a great game that deserves to thrive.",Dark Eclipse
3798,"The game was a joy to experience and I cannot wait to see how the world is saved. Visual novel fan or not, the characters, writing, and unique gameplay are all easily appreciated and enjoyed.

3803," does a remarkably fine job of aping the design and simple brilliance of Zelda puzzles, while putting its own unique spin on things as it does so. Though its puzzles can sometimes be unfairly or frustratingly designed, a pleasing visual style, meaty campaign and generally satisfying gameplay loop make this a win in our book; we’d absolutely suggest you give  a try (especially if you’re a Zelda fan). There’s plenty to love about this quirky puzzle game, and it’s one you’ll likely want to revisit from time to time.",Vesta

In fact, the game has so completely missed the mark on that that it’s almost insulting that the developers used names like “Hastor” and “Cthulhu” to describe your foes, rather than replace them with more original monster names. Once I settled past that disappointment, though, I discovered that  is also a game that so cleanly represents everything good about the dungeon crawler genre that I found it hard to put down. The fact that it’s the perfect introduction to the dungeon crawler genre also makes it the perfect first example on the new hardware.",The Lost Child
3818," introduces us a man who does not accept the death of the person he loves, and thanks to his experience working as an explorer and researcher, he believes he has found a way to resurrect his wife.

3821," is a fantastic game that blends racing and a team-based dynamic to craft a memorable experience. It plays like a dream and offers up a surprisingly high amount of strategy to excel. By offering up enough twists on a traditional racing game, it finds ways to create excitement that haven’t been done before in the genre and is a must for anyone looking for an arcade-style futuristic racing experience.

3827,"’s hook, for me, remains the need to take over as a psychiatrist. It’s not as easy as sitting comfortably and saying things like, “and how does that make you feel?” As Doctor Dekker’s replacement you are toeing the line between your patients’ sanity and insanity, having to decipher clues in their personality or stories to gain insight into what to ask. The supernatural, Cthulhu-centric story behind the game is also a shining point that has led me to finally break my hesitancy to read Lovecraft. Your own sanity comes into question.",The Infectious Madness of Doctor Dekker
3828,"You may well find  to be offensive and intolerable. But that’s all the more reason to experience it and discuss it, and because it’s backed by a really good light gun experience that is bigger and (on balance) better than its predecessor, this game is one of the most playable and interesting transgressive franchises the Japanese industry has ever produced.",Gal*Gun 2

3846,"Ultimately,  relies on your capacity to dig into its subtleties. On that overt level it's an obtuse and obviously indie game, and it's really quite demanding of the player; it asks them to figure their own way through the game, and it asks them to really commit to an emotional connection to these hopeless little cubs.

3853," Is the closest thing we have to the greatness of Jagged Alliance 2. It's a very trimmed game, delivering the experience rather than a carbon copy of the series. You still have to care for your mercs' health and gear, as well as carrying capacity, but at a much less grognardy level. I dunno if 1.13 mod fanatics will be pleased, but for the others, it's a good introduction to what Jagged Alliance used to represent.",Jagged Alliance: Rage!

Online connectivity would have done wonders for potential replay value, but for pick-up-and-play Switch gaming, this one is hard to beat.",Jumping Joe & Friends
3871,"If you're after a VR game that's fun in small doses but has lots of long-lasting appeal, then it's quite easy to recommend . The action's a little repetitive to consider playing through more than a few stages at once without it becoming to feel like a chore, but it's an accomplished title nonetheless.",Time Carnage
3872,"While there's not much in Pribyslavitz that's worth returning to, rebuilding it and reaping the monetary benefits is a great experience.",Kingdom Come: Deliverance - From The Ashes
3873,"If you want another FIFA, that probably won’t do, but if you’re looking for something that captures of the vibe of off-brand sports games from decades ago, it’ll do you just fine.",Legendary Eleven
3874," is a fun platformer with an interestingly challenging twist. The levels are well designed, but depending on skill, they may not take too long. The story is your run of the mill "" slay the bad guy and save the girl"" plot, but that meshes perfectly with a world of knights and monsters.",Castle of Heart
3875," is a fun, dynamic experience provided by Bandai Namco. Despite the fact that it is obviously aimed towards the anime and manga fan base, players looking for a challenge in online gameplay should also give a try to this solid fighting game.",Black Clover: Quartet Knights
3876,"Despite some very annoying bugs that absolutely need to be addressed, the game is both a wonderful online experience and an underrated solo adventure if you enjoy the exploration aspect of games such as No Man’s Sky.",Fallout 76
3877," lacks refinement and complexity, that much goes without saying. However, for those that seek a non-stop action-packed hack-and-slash adventure, there’s a lot to look forward to within. It may be repetitive in the long run, but there’s no denying that  offers a decent story, empowering gameplay and enough content to merit a recommendation.",Extinction
3878,"It's fun when you cooperate with friends and get out of the crowd of zombies by sneaky ways. But due to the dull shooting experience and repeated puzzles, it hardly ever satisfies me.",OVERKILL's The Walking Dead
3879,"Despite not having its own identity, Immortal Unchained offers exactly what it proposes in its playable aspect. Any fan of 'Dark Souls'- like games will appreciate this game for its level design and fine tuned difficulty, despite its technical shortcomings.",Immortal: Unchained
3880," hasn’t aged particularly well in an era of excellent, smooth, quick third person shooters and brawlers, but I still found myself having fun buying all-in with the simple pleasures that the game does succeed with. Don’t buy this game if you’re looking for a tight, polished, nuanced experience, but consider giving it some of your time for a nostalgic trip through some light-hearted fun.",Bullet Witch
3881, is a great physics puzzler and with a 5 dollar price tag on the Nintendo store it could be a great little title for rainy afternoons or the morning commute. However if you tend to lean towards your phone for those times this title might be better off left in the dugout.,Baseball Riot
3882,"I’m so delighted to say that Lust For Darkness is the real deal. The fact that I can compare it to one of the greatest erotic thrillers of all time in Eyes Wide Shut, and not break down laughing, is in itself is a great credit to the developers. The game lacks the sheer mastery and refinement that Stanley Kubrick had over his canvas, but this is still leagues ahead of the clumsy, overly-simple idea of “horror” that most game developers aspire to.",Lust for Darkness
3883," brings back from the past the core elements of the series, with a nice story that manages to drag the player into it.",Fear Effect Sedna
3884,"The very best examples of nostalgic homages are those that add something in the process. Goichi Suda's grindhouse-toned games, for example, add all kinds of stylistic features that help to build on the thematic basis.  isn't that game. It's slavishly devoted to something very obscure and doesn't do enough to appeal to people who don't know the base material. But that's not to say it's a poor game. Its energy and ballsy attitude is engrossing all in itself.",Milanoir
3885,"Crisis on the Planet of the Apes is fast and fun, delivering a brief jaunt into the oppressive world of the beloved sci-fi universe. While the experience is light in the narrative department, the gameplay innovation and high production values more than make up for story’s shortcomings. With the release of this game, FoxNext VR Studios have broken free of the movie-tie-in stereotype, and have established themselves as a VR developer to watch.",Crisis on the Planet of the Apes VR
3886,"If you’re looking for a game to get the whole family gathered around the TV - or your Nintendo Switch in tabletop mode - during the school holidays or at a party, Carnival Games offers plenty of silly mini-games to get everyone swinging their Joy-Con. It’s nothing remarkable, but the new games do offer a little more variety than the previous versions, so if you’re looking for a quick pick-up-and-play alternative to Super Mario Party, this colourful collection could be the virtual funfair trip for you.",Carnival Games for Nintendo Switch
3887,"Having a modern-day video game with some of the most beloved cartoon characters from our youth is certainly a novelty, and at worst, that’s exactly what  manages to be. But at best, it’s a solid entry into a rather stagnant kart racing genre. It may be lacking a bit of personality and polish, but zooming around the track as Tommy Pickles or Patrick Star is a lot of fun.",Nickelodeon Kart Racers
3888," is a game in which size does matter. We can say that it is very innovative, but it needs more things. Not only in a specific part, but in everything in general. We could say that the game has left us wanting more.",Morphies Law
3889," with its mix of stealth and action is entertaining. After the moderate entry, the mysterious story picks up speed.",Past Cure
3890,"While a lot of focus on VR games comes from playing games in a first-person view, it’s great to have a change of pace with a real-time strategy game that includes an FPS element. On the outside,  doesn’t look inviting. Once you’re plopped in to the battlefield and realize all the small things needed to win on top of managing a base, though, it’s enthralling. The controls take a while to get comfortable with, but you’ll notice your own progression. As great as Resident Evil 7 or Gran Turismo Sport are in VR,  is the most fun I’ve had with PSVR. Just make it so players can retry a mission and not force them to exit out.",Out of Ammo
3891,"At its best,  captures the feeling of working toward a big dream while struggling to even buy your next meal. Unfortunately, those moments come sandwiched between a lot of repetition as the initially fun races become a chore that you have to do over and over again. 's unique setting, filled out with great art and a killer soundtrack, is fun to explore for a while, but the game runs out of gas a little too quickly.",Desert Child
3892,"If you like horror, the macabre or the notion of taking a personal voyage through Dante’s Inferno with a touch of Gigeresque visuals… this may be up your alley (or down your abyssal chasm).",Agony
3893,Ark Park is not the game we hoped to recommend to all owners of PlayStation VR.,ARK Park
3894,"Despite being very improvable in all its aspects,  is today the best realistic actual tennis game today. That doesn't mean that is better than Top Spin 4 (2011).",Tennis World Tour
3895,"A simple implementation game but one that will keep you strangely hooked on it with the goal of breaking our own records, reaching the highest wave with our friends.",Yet Another Zombie Defense HD
3896,​A good action game with a bit of tactical elements: if you love the shooter genre you'll surely enjoy playing .​,Bravo Team
3897,"Kursk isn’t a bad video game, but its many flaws keep us from recommending it.",KURSK
3898," is a love letter to Gundam fandom to the point where the devs can’t imagine that anyone playing wouldn’t know the mechs inside and out. In light of this, the real testament to ’s success is the fact that its obvious passion for its subject made me want to learn.",New Gundam Breaker
3899," isn't a very good VR title, It isn't that good of a game in general, With all that it tries to do it doesn't do much of anything well. Not only is Gunrave VR a poor game its a poor use of an excellent license.",Gungrave VR
3900,"No matter how salacious things may get, Reflexions never loses sight of the sweetness at the game’s core – fundamentally, this is a game about a girl attempting to overcome her shyness and tell a boy how she feels about him. While I’ll be happy to get back to battling demons and ninjas when the next full entry in the series is released, I won’t say that this is a waste of the franchise or a disrespectful use of its main character – just the opposite, in fact.",Senran Kagura Reflexions
3901,"If everything else worked as expected, it would be a great game, but at the moment all its good intentions fall behind too many technical issues.",Underworld Ascendant
3902,"In the end,  definitely harkens back to a time period where point/shoot had a different meaning in an arcade experience than it does now. The game maintains a nostalgic design, which certainly makes sense for the experience, but the experience’s longevity will be questioned depending on player expectations. This goes back to what you understand about a game’s intentions. If you know going into it that you’re going to get an arcade shooter, then you may not be disappointed. If you’re expecting a deeper experience than just point/shoot, then you may not find it here.",Heavy Fire: Red Shadow
3903," is a good horror game inspired by great games like Alien: Isolation and Resident Evil Revelations. However, the game sins by executing mechanics like melee combat, for example. Although the graphics are excellent and it has an excellent atmosphere, the weird movement of the enemies makes the game look odd at times. The game is frightening at times when you walk alone on the ship listening to voices succumbing to the dark, you do get some scares, but it is not frequent. The gameplay is within the standards of the current horror games. Despite its problems,  is a highly recommended game for horror fans and games like Resident Evil Revelations and Alien: Isolation.",Hollow
3904,ONE PIECE: Grand Cruise feels like a trip aboard a dinghy rather than a pirate ship. Even simply allowing for free travel around the boat as the show’s various characters react and move around would’ve given players something more interesting to do.,One Piece: Grand Cruise
3905,You can have fun with this game - in a weird sense. The video-episodes are amateurish and the topics mundane. Nonetheless there are some interesting moments that made me laugh and think about male dating behaviour.,Super Seducer: How to Talk to Girls
3906,"Fantasy Hero ~unsigned legacy~ tries to contribute to the RPG segment of the Nintendo Switch catalog and it features some interesting elements of progression but overall, its action gets repetitive and dull too quickly early on. The game's visuals and sound also betray its age, meaning that it's not in a position to provide a pleasant audiovisual experience either, which only gets aggravated by several flaws that should have been corrected.",Fantasy Hero: Unsigned Legacy
3907,"All in all not a bad game, especially for a first outing. A little rough around the edges, but still a game that's worth a try.",Gene Rain
3908,"It's not without its issues, but these are the kinds of experiences that really stick in the mind, and I'd rather that that yet another stock-standard action game that neatly fits within structures that we've already seen dozens of times before.",The Quiet Man
3909,"Despite mediocre graphics, terrible animations and countless other defects at first I thought that  has some potential. It does not. It quickly revealed itself as awfully boring and hollow. [07/2018, p.62]",Wild West Online
